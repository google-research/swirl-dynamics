  """Reshapes data from the channel to spatial dims as a way to upsample.

  As an example, for an input of shape (*batch, x, y, z) and block_shape of
  (a, b), additional spatial dimensions are first formed from the channel
  dimension (always the last one), i.e. reshaped into
  (*batch, x, y, a, b, z//(a*b)). Then the new axes are interleaved with the
  original ones to arrive at shape (*batch, x, a, y, b, z//(a*b)). Finally, the
  new axes are merged with the original axes to yield final shape
  (*batch, x*a, y*b, z//(a*b)).

  Args:
    inputs: The input array to upsample.
    block_shape: The shape of the block that will be formed from the channel
      dimension. The number of elements (i.e. prod(block_shape) must divide the
      number of channels).

  Returns:
    The upsampled array.
