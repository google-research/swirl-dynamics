"""Different strategies for downweighting loss from rolled out steps.

For each method, the input `num_time_steps` (int) corresponds to the number of
steps to be included in a batch, where the first time step corresponds to the
initial condition. Thus `num_time_steps = k + 1`, where `k` is number of rollout
steps.
