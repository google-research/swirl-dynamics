This package contains example code to run downscaling models described in
research paper [GenFocal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08079).

Code for the debiasing stage can be found in [projects/debiasing/rectified_flow](https://github.com/google-research/swirl-dynamics/tree/main/swirl_dynamics/projects/debiasing/rectified_flow)
and code for the super-resolution stage can be found in [projects/probabilistic_diffusion/downscaling/era5](https://github.com/google-research/swirl-dynamics/tree/main/swirl_dynamics/projects/probabilistic_diffusion/downscaling/era5).
